    <h1> For this homework, I displayed the world map in nine different projections. I used WGS84, the Aitoff Projection, EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and I chose _______ and ______ for my additional two projections.   </h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:blueviolet"> The Earth is a a three dimensional object, so all two dimensional maps have distortion in at least one of the following categories: shape, area, distance, and direction. No projection is perfect, so for this homework assignment, I looked at different world projections to see how they ehibited distortion of the Earth's surface.   </h2>
    <p> In order to display the map in different projections using QGIS, I first downloaded the data and map files. Then, using QGIS I</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>My observations:  This projection has distortion of area and shape at the poles, while the areas nearet the equator have the least distortion.  </h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>My observations: This projection shows distortion of shape, area, distance and direction. My observation leads me to think this projection is better suited for maps at a smaller scale than it is for maps of entire countries, let alone the entire world.   </h3>

    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>My observations:  This map has distortion of area, esspecially near the poles. An example can be seen in Greenland, which has an exaggerated area.  </h3>
